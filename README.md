# Most Frequent Character Program (C++)

This project contains a C++ program that identifies and prints the character that occurs most frequently in a user-provided string.

## How the Program Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a string.
2. The program converts the string to uppercase to ensure case-insensitive counting.
3. It iterates over the string, counting the occurrences of each character using an array that tracks the frequency of ASCII characters.
4. The character with the highest occurrence is identified and displayed along with the number of times it appears.
